<p>Ice cream is a frozen dessert typically made from milk.</p>
<hr>
<p>We love ice cream! In fact, so does most of New Zealand. Did you know that New Zealand is the world’s largest consumer of ice cream per capita? It’s true.</p>
<p>ce cream’s main ingredient is milk. Milk and milk products contain a great balance of protein, fat and carbohydrates and are a good source of nutrients, including calcium, riboflavin, phosphorous, vitamins A and B12.</p>
<p> scientist at Kyorin University in Tokyo conducted a study to see whether an ice cream breakfast could stimulate the brain. The researcher compared a group of people who had ice cream with a group who had a glass of cold water first thing in the morning – the group who ate ice cream were much more alert. </p>
